阅读注意事项：
1. 谈到实验，重要的不是过程**而是结论**
2. **冒号**之后是重点！

做题注意：
1. 注意干扰选项很喜欢对原文**代词**指代的对象进行**概念偷换**，翻译的时候把握好代词指代对象，不要仅仅翻译为它
2. +

*****
## 例证题
1. 标志：example   case   illustrate    demonstrate    to show   to be cited/mentioned    refer
2. 例子本身不重要，重要的是例子所支持的观点；观点一般在例子前，有时候也在例子后
例子    ==    观点
观点    ==    例子
（一定要仔细阅读前后的**逻辑关系**）
3. 注意干扰选项设计：就事论事，取反，主次颠倒等
### 例证题升级版
**不要迷恋转折，转折点恰恰也可能是设坑的地方**
升级版在于上面的第二点——**观点与例子的关系不仅仅是因果关系，还可能是转折关系**，这时例证本身想要说明的意思与后面/前面的观点是**相反的**。

## 词汇题
唐叔总结：
1. 逻辑判断：词汇题找定位好的句子的上下句（或者本句句内）熟词与生词之间的逻辑关系，判断其是相同/相反来推断生词意思（也就是通过逻辑关系找同义词或反义词）。【生词特指题目中提问的单词】
2. 主旨判断：数理段落大意，根据大意去推测词汇含义
例题：2006 Text3-T21 、2005 Text2-2（看视频）

## 细节题
### 标志
1. what， why， which， beacuse等
2. 细节信息丰富，补充完整题干内容
3. 非其他五大题型
### 方法
1. 根据定位句子的前后句，特别是如果有代词指代要清晰找到代词指代对象，而不是仅仅翻译为“它、这个、这些等”，
2. 注意原文和选项中的同义替换，此处可能包含正确答案。
3. 一定注意贴合文章主旨，可以通过这个排除干扰选项或确定答案

*****
## 态度题
作者一般只有三个态度：
1. 正面：positive, optimistic, approval, supportive
2. 负面：negative, pessimistic, disapproval, critical, doubtful, suspicious, skeptical, questionable
3. 中立：neutral (中立的）, objective, impartial, disinterested (客观的；公正的)
4. **小墓碑（看到即排除，不可能选）**：uninterested, unconcerned, indifferent, confused, puzzled, biased, prejudice, contemptuous, subjective
如何归纳文章作者感情色彩呢：
1. 文章框架——各段落主题句（一般在段首）
2. 形容词&&副词（注意他们的感情色彩）
3. 转折处
4. 情态动词后（后面可能包含作者建议）
*****
## 推理题
### 出题点
文章中不起眼的**括号中的内容**可能作为出题点，考研阅读无跳读。

推理题目答案的语气缓和，可能还有类似 may 一样一样语气的情态动词，但注意不是看到 may 就可以就可以选的，历年题目已经出现在选项中添加 may 作为作为干扰选项的例子，因此还是需要踏踏实实数理逻辑。
*****
## 中心思想题
### 方法
1. 串线法：将各段首末句串成一个整体
2. 中心句：
	- 以**问题开头**的疑问句的回答
	- 独句端——仅一个句子构成一个段落
	- 少数派——作者观点与大多数人**相反**
	- 时间对比（Now）
1. 中心词：文中反复高频出现的词

## 题目
### 2006 Text 1
Text 1
In spite of “endless talk of difference,"American society is an amazing machine for homogenizing people. There is “the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and the casualness and absence of deference" characteristic of popular culture. People are absorbed into "a culture of consumption" launched by the 19 th-century department stores that offered “vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops catering to a knowledgeable elite" these were stores "anyone could enter, regardless of class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.” The mass media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.

Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory Rodriguez reports that today's immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of the population; in 1900, 13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890,9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices of assimilation-language, home ownership and intermarriage. 

The 1990 Census revealed that “a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most common countries of origin spoke English 'well' or 'very well' after ten years of residence." The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English.“By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant families." Hence the description of America as a “graveyard" for languages. By 1996 foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 percent,Higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.

Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics "have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born whites and blacks."By the third generation, one third of Hlispanic women are married to non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.

Rodriguez notes that chiIdren in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet "some Americans fear that immigrants living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation's assimilative power."

Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America's turbulent past, today's social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social environment.
